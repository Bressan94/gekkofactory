				<h3>New site and first post</h3>
				<p></p>
				Hey! If you're reading this, welcome! In all my sincerity I don't expect anyboby to read this, but if you checked all the site and still came here to read some of my thoughts, welcome again! Haha.
				<p></p>
				In this first post I want to talk a little bit about the idea of what made me create this site/blog. First, I don't like social medias in general, I feel they create this feel that we're creating content for others instead for ourselves, so I'm always inclined to not post anything there, because I don't feel I'm in charge of what I'm doing there. Second, I wanted a place to archive my stuff and share my thoughts on things, I feel that sometimes there's stuff that I want to talk that only I care, and normally these thoughts just vanish into the air, so I wanted to archive them too. And sometimes I'll share stuff that I working on or that I intend to work on because this is who I'm, always doing something haha.
				<p></p>
				I pretend to post something every week, more because I want to create a routine of writing and keep a health archive of my thoughts. And if you reader notices that I didn't post a week or two, bear with this lazy artist here, that'll probably be imersed playing some cool RPG, or watching some cool Anime or Tokusatsu.
				<p></p>
				See ya!

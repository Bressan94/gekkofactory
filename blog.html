				<h3>A unofficial magical girl</h3>
				<p>
				Some years ago, at 2015, me and my friend Telio watched one of the Parallel Works from Gurren Lagann, and one of them was one where two of the characters of the show are living in your modern day and transform in mahou shoujos and obviously Gurren Lagann is there on too (it's his show). We thought the idea of having mahou shoujos using mechas was a cool idea, and yeah, others shows already did this before, but it was really under used. We wanted to take this concept and make our own story, and then it was born, the idea of a girl who gets to be a mahou shoujo but she dosen't have any magical powers, and she needs to resort to firearms and mechas.
				<p>
				This was the whole baseline, so Telio wrote the script for a one-shot and I drawed the oneshot... But life got in the way, and my skills too were not good at the time, so the oneshot we had was one with a fun script and with unfinished art. And you are asking me: "why I'm talking about it?", it's simple, ever since I "finished" the art for this one-shot I'm eager to rework it, to give the art it deserves. I really love this one-shot idea, the characters, the whole aesthetic we got for it, and I feel I didn't do justice for what it should be.
				<p>
				I never talked about this idea publicaly, only for personal friends, but I'll share a pdf of the original one-shot, I feel like at least I should archive it, even if I don't like the art I made for it. It's only in portuguese, so bear with it, because I'll not translate it.

				<p>
				If you enjoyed this little one-shot, you can expect a new version with more pages, mostly because at the time we wanted to make for a festival, and the limit was 32 pages. And everything feels so fast-paced at this one-shot that I feel it needs some pages to breath a bit haha. And for the new version I already made some new concepts, you can check them out:

				<p>
				I'll not give a time for this to be done, because I want to work more freely on it, but I expect that at least I can come back and read this post and feel happy that I gave this one-shot the art it deserves in the future.
				<p>
				See ya!

   				<h3>13.06.23</h3>
   				<p>
				<h3>New site and first post</h3>
				<p>
				Hey! If you're reading this, welcome! In all my sincerity I don't expect anyboby to read this, but if you checked all the site and still came here to read some of my thoughts, welcome again! Haha.
				<p>
				In this first post I want to talk a little bit about the idea of what made me create this site/blog. First, I don't like social medias in general, I feel they create this feel that we're creating content for others instead for ourselves, so I'm always inclined to not post anything there, because I don't feel I'm in charge of what I'm doing there. Second, I wanted a place to archive my stuff and share my thoughts on things, I feel that sometimes there's stuff that I want to talk that only I care, and normally these thoughts just vanish into the air, so I wanted to archive them too. And sometimes I'll share stuff that I working on or that I intend to work on because this is who I'm, always doing something haha.
				<p>
				I pretend to post something every week, more because I want to create a routine of writing and keep a health archive of my thoughts. And if you reader notices that I didn't post a week or two, bear with this lazy artist here, that'll probably be imersed playing some cool RPG, or watching some cool Anime or Tokusatsu.
				<p>
				See ya!
